## Andrew Beck
- Nuclear Bomb Explosion
- Bomb falls from the top of the screen, and once it hits the bottom, particles shoot out in every direction above the surface.
- Already built buildings will get destroyed by the bomb particles
## Tenji Vang
- Minecraft creeper explosion effect
- Creeper (green block) walks on screen then explodes after a period of time, shooting out explosion particles.
- (If I'm not lazy) Steve walks onto screen and if hit by explosion, his block model will gain upward and outward velocity, disappearing after a few seconds.
